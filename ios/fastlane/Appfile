# app_identifier("[[APP_IDENTIFIER]]") # The bundle identifier of your app
# apple_id("[[APPLE_ID]]") # Your Apple email address

# For more information about the Appfile, see:
#     https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/#appfile

# Uncomment and configure these when setting up for a real project:
# app_identifier("com.example.flutterProjects")
# apple_id("your-apple-id@example.com")
# team_id("YOUR_TEAM_ID")

# For CI/CD builds, we don't need Apple ID configuration
# since we're building without codesigning
